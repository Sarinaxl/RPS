# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simple Rock Paper Scissors game using pure JavaScript and Bootstrap.

## Practice Phases

### Phase 1

In the first phase of this practice, you will focus on single-player functionality:

1. **Pure JavaScript**: Develop the game logic using only JavaScript.
2. **HTML Semantics**: Ensure adherence to HTML semantic principles learned in previous lessons.
3. **Repository Structure**: Follow the predefined structure provided in the repository.
4. **Color Variables**: Utilize color variables for consistent styling.
5. **Game Start**: Initiate the game upon selecting one action (rock, paper, or scissors).
6. **Computer AI**: Implement a simple AI that randomly selects an action.
7. **Design Reference**: Refer to the Figma design for the visual layout.

### Phase 2 (0.35 SCORE)

The second phase introduces multiplayer functionality:

1. **Multiplayer Mode**: Implement a multiplayer feature.
2. **Input Handling**: Create event listeners to handle inputs from both players.
3. **Keyboard Controls**: First player controls actions using "A", "S", and "D" keys.
4. **Arrow Key Controls**: Second player controls actions using arrow keys."← and ↑ and →"
5. **Result Display**: Display the game result based on actions selected by both players.

Please note that for Phase 2, there is no predefined design. Focus on functionality and user experience.
